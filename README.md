# TERRA_DSB
Hello! Thank you or your interest in the data analysis for the research paper: Telomeric RNA in the Telomeric DNA Double-Strand Break Response (Al Turki, et. al 2021)

Here I use the power of modern data science to elucidate how TElomeric Repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) responds to telomeric double stranded breaks, with special focus on how TERRA response varies with the cell cycle. 
This data is being used to progreess scientists' understanding of how cells cope with telomerric damadge, which has tremendous implications for cancer biology and organism health.
This data and analysis are intended for the uses dictated by the authors of the paper.
Please enjoy and feel free to contact me with any inquiries: Aidan.Lewis21@alumni.colostate.edu
